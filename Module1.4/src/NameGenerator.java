Task 1: A name generator

Write a program that generates random names by combining first and last names 
from hard-coded name arrays. The program should work as follows:

Create two arrays, firstNames and lastNames, which contain first and last names.

Ask the user how many random names the program should generate.

Generate random names using the following logic:

Choose the index value for the first name randomly.
Choose the index value for the last name randomly.
Use the index values to create a random full name (i.e. first name and last name).
Print the generated full name.
Repeat these steps as many times as the user-specified number of names to generate.
