# task 1

(W) Suppose you are compiling statistics on the age structure of students in our group. You should then draw 1000 age values and these should be distributed in the same way as the age distribution of the students in the group. How do you do it? Explain the algorithm in enough details to be able to program it directly. Take an idea/model from the example on section Your own distribution.

## Answer

### Student Age Distribution Simulation

To simulate the age structure of our group, we will follow a specific algorithm to draw 1000 age values. These values will reflect the approxinate (I don't have exact) age distribution of the students in our group. The steps we'll take are outlined below:

Step 1: Collect Age Data
First, we need to gather data on the age distribution of students in our group. This involves determining the percentage of students for each age within the group.

Step 2: Create an Age Distribution Representation
With the data collected, we create a representation of the age distribution. This will include each age and its corresponding percentage in the group. For example, if 20% of our students are 20 years old, we note this down.

Step 3: Convert to Cumulative Distribution
We then convert these percentages into a cumulative distribution. This helps in mapping random numbers to specific ages.

Step 4: Generate Random Numbers
Next, we generate 1000 random numbers between 1 and 100. These numbers will be used to simulate the age distribution.

Step 5: Map Random Numbers to Ages
For each random number, we determine the corresponding age based on our cumulative distribution. This mapping will ensure that the simulated ages reflect the actual distribution of our group.

Step 6: Repeat and Tally
We repeat this process for all 1000 random numbers, keeping a tally for each age.

Step 7: Result
At the end of this process, we will have a simulated age distribution of 1000 values, closely resembling the actual age structure of our group.

This approach allows us to accurately reflect the age distribution in our simulations, ensuring that our statistical analysis is as close to reality as possible.

Markdown format does not support complex tables natively, but you can use simple ASCII-style tables or list formats to represent data if needed.
